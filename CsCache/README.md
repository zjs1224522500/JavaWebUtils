JSR107 (JCache)
===============

About
-----

*JCache* is the Java caching API. It was defined by JSR107. It defines a standard Java Caching API for use by developers and a standard SPI ("Service
 Provider Interface") for use by implementers.

Maven snippet:

    <dependency>
      <groupId>javax.cache</groupId>
      <artifactId>cache-api</artifactId>
      <version>1.0.0</version>
    </dependency>


Maven Central Releases
----------------------

Releases of jars for binaries, source and javadoc are available on Maven central.

Download the cache-api from <https://oss.sonatype.org/index.html#nexus-search;quick~javax-cache>

or use the following Maven snippet:

    <dependency>
      <groupId>javax.cache</groupId>
      <artifactId>cache-api</artifactId>
      <version>1.1.1</version>
    </dependency>

Javadoc
-------

The JavaDoc is available as a jar with the releases. You can also find the JavaDoc [online](http://www.javadoc.io/doc/javax.cache/cache-api/1.1.1).

Specification
-------------

The specification is available online as a [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ijduF_tmHvBaUS7VBBU2ZN8_eEBiFaXXg9OI0_ZxCrA/edit?usp=sharing).

Reference Implementation
------------------------

The reference implementation ("RI") source is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/jsr107/RI).

This implementation is not meant for production use. For that we would refer you
to one of the many high quality open source and commercial implementations of JCache. See the [official list of compatible implementions](https://jcp.org/aboutJava/communityprocess/implementations/jsr107/index.html),
and also the community maintained [JSR107 Test Zoo](https://github.com/cruftex/jsr107-test-zoo/blob/master/report.md).

The RI is there to ensure that the specification and API works as its only purpose.

For example, some things that we leave out:

- tiered storage. A simple on-heap store is used.
- replicated or distributed caching

Why did we do this? Because a much greater engineering effort, which gets put into the open source and commercial caches
which implement this API, is required to accomplish these things.

Having said that, the RI is Apache 2 and is a correct implementation of the spec. It can be used to create new cache
implementations.

Building From Source
--------------------

Building uses Maven in all modules. Maven 3.3.9 - 3.5.4 have been tested.

JCache is compatible with Java 6 to Java 11. We have tested building from Java 8 and Java 11.

See each module's README.md for build instructions.

Please add the following to your settings.xml to enable the CDI RI to be sucked down from JBoss.
